          <img src="images/writing/newspaper.jpg" alt="Hijabi Monologues published article in The Miami Hurricane"/>
          <p> I wrote this article for my journalism class in the spring semester of my freshman year. Univerity of Miami alum Sahar Ullah brought her highly  acclaimed "Hijabi Monologues" to campus for a single night showing at the Bill Cosford Cinema. After attending the show and doing some additional reporting, my finished artcile was published in  The Miami Hurricane.

          <h2>Social media/Aerie partnership</h2>
          <p>In the summer of 2019, I was chosen to be an Aerie Brand Ambassador. This experience has completely changed my perspective on social media and body image, as well as the strategies that companies use to reach their target audiences. Below are just a few of my posts along with a sample blog post that wrote for a scholarship thet are offering.
